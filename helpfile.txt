Welcome to Islands!

Click on the grid to toggle a square from sea to land.

Black squares are water, white squares are land.

Land squares that touch eachother are islands. The number of islands is displayed.

To create one or more lakes, create a large island, then turn some of the squares
within the island to water.

Sea shores have a green border. Lake shores have a blue border.

The clear button resets the grid.
The reverse button switches all land to water and all water to land.

The grid is represented in code as an undirected graph. Click here for more information.
